# Pilomar Pico firmware

## Firmware for driving two standard stepper drivers

The pico will appear as a USB network device and two serial ports, the first of which is the console, which is also available on a JST-SM connector on the board.

It serves a REST API as described in the doorAPI.yaml file.
